# A Timer/Stopwatch App
I made this with Odin, using Clay for the layout and raylib as the renderer. Use the **S** key to swap between the modes, and press the small moon/sun icon in the top left corner to swap between colour modes (it is on lightmode by default).

To download the project files, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/scheinheiser/odin-clay-timer
```
Enter the director and build the files with this:
```
odin build . -o:speed
```
After this, start the app through running the executable.
This app was made purely to learn Odin more and try out Clay for the first time, I won't try to fix any bugs/issues that you might encounter.
I also leaned quite heavily on [this existing project](https://github.com/A1029384756/mixologist) to understand how some of the C code would look in Odin, so thanks to them.
